# Omega-Cloud-Demo
Pulls temperature data from registered Omega devices, and serves them webapp style.

## TODOs

* Remove `node_modules` from the Repo and add it to the .gitignore file
  * Dependencies can just be installed using `npm install` when server is to be deployed
* `package.json` updates:
  * Update the URLs
  * Add a command for `npm start` - should be the command used to start the whole server
* Feature request: config json file command should be just a command string, the script should then split it into the string and array required by the onion cloud api call
* Update this readme with a `how to setup` (steps to setup from scratch on a server) and `how to run` instructions
