# Omega-Cloud-Demo
Pulls temperature data from registered Omega devices, and serves them webapp style.

## TODOs

* Remove `node_modules` from the Repo and add it to the .gitignore file
  * Dependencies can just be installed using `npm install` when server is to be deployed
* `package.json` updates:
  * Update the URLs
  * Add a command for `npm start` - should be the command used to start the whole server
